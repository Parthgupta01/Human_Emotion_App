# 😊 Human Emotion Classification

This project focuses on **detecting and classifying human emotions** from text using **Deep Learning** techniques built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## 🚀 Overview
The model analyzes text data (such as comments or messages) and classifies them into different human emotions like *happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise,* and *neutral.*

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- TensorFlow & Keras 🤖  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib 📊  
- NLTK for text preprocessing  

## ⚙️ Features
- Text cleaning and tokenization  
- LSTM-based deep learning model  
- Emotion prediction using trained model  
- Easy to extend for other NLP tasks  

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset consists of text samples labeled with their corresponding emotions.

## 📈 Model Architecture
- Embedding Layer  
- LSTM Layers  
- Dense Layers  
- Softmax Output  

## 💡 Results
Achieved good accuracy in predicting emotions across multiple classes.
